* Added missing experiment description if needed
* Added description to several objects in the file
   * units table and related columns
   * trials table and related columns
   * stimulus presentations table and related columns
   * optogenetic_stimulation time intervals 

### TODO 
* Add stimulus template data for natural scenes, natural movies, and natural movie shuffled stimuli
* add description to several objects in the file (see report for full information)
