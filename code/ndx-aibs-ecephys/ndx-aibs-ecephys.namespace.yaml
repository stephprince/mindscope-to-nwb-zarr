    Includes support for NWB 2.3.0 and later. In version 0.2.0, 
    the data type `EcephysSpecimen` extends `Subject` and specifies 
    a required attribute "strain". This attribute has been made into 
    a dataset in version 0.3.0 to be compatible with NWB 2.3.0 and 
    later where the data type `Subject` specifies "strain" as a dataset.
